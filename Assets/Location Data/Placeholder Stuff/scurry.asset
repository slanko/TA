  cityDescription: 'of all the places you''ve been, scurry sure is.... one of them.


    what
    a town!! if you can even call it that.

    being here makes you feel like you
    should be scurrying away soon yourself.


    while you''re here though, you
    can amuse yourself with the trade centre, or maybe try the Factory Bar if you
    need a rest.


    sadly enough that''s all there is to it.'
  cityActivitiesDescription: 'there''s not much to do in scurry.


    there is a
    trading post and a bar you can stay at if you need to.'
