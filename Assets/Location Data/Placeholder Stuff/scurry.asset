  cityDescription: 'of all the places you''ve been, scurry sure is.... one of them.


    what a town!! if you can even call it that.

    being here makes you feel like you should be scurrying away soon yourself.


    while you''re here though, you can amuse yourself with the trade centre, or maybe
    try the Factory Bar if you need a rest.


    sadly enough that''s all there is to it.'
  cityActivitiesDescription: 'there''s not much to do in scurry.


    there is a trading post and a bar you can stay at if you need to.'
