      strangely, it
      looks like he has no vehicle of his own, despite being out in the middle of
      nowhere.


      "you look desperate. fortunately, i am not. what do you need?"


      he
      puts a briefcase on the ground in front of him.'

      tentatively, you click it open
      and find exactly what you asked for within.


      "no need to pay me back."
      he says, almost offhandedly. "karma will pay for this deed."


      you hand
      him back the now empty suitcase and he walks off into the tundra.


      you
      feel a sinking feeling in your stomach.'
