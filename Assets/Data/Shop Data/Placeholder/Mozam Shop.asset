  shopDescription: 'they take you out back, to where they keep all the frozen stuff.


    you''re
    surprised they don''t get more thefts, what with the freezer just sitting behind
    the main building like that, but you guess there really is some goodwill to be
    shared amongst your peers here.'
  shopFlavourText: foodmin's waiting.
  shopTalk:
  - '"keep it quick if you don''t mind" foodmin says nonchalantly. "there''s some
    mighty hungry folk in there."'
  friendlyShopDescription: 'it''s not long before foodmin drags you out back himself,
    in the hopes of trading with you again.


    you get the feeling that whether
    you like it or not these days you''ll be seeing a lot of this freezer, and even
    more of it''s contents.'
  friendlyShopFlavourText: foodmin's watching you eagerly.
  friendlyShopTalk:
  - PLACEHOLDER TEXT
  unfriendlyShopDescription: it takes a lot of convincing to let them let you get
    a look at the food out back. it'd honestly be easier to steal it at this point,
    but you'd rather not ruin your good name here any more than you need to.
  unfriendlyShopFlavourText: foodmin's got his eye on you.
  unfriendlyShopTalk:
  - foodmin doesn't want to speak to you. just hurry up and make a deal.
