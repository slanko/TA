  cityDescription: 'all the way out here, seemingly bereft of any other buildings
    to keep it company, sits the MOZAM all night diner.


    somehow, almost in
    defiance of its remote placement, it sees a steady stream of visitors thanks
    to it''s remarkably good food.'
  cityActivitiesDescription: a diner's a great place to meet new people, or maybe
    you can get some food to take with you.
