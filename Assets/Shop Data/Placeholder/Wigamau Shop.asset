  - 'trademin appears to be freaking out a little bit.


    "everyone in this town
    likes me too much, man!! you''re the first outsider i''ve spoken to in ages!"

    leans in a bit, almost as if inspecting you.

    trade, right?"'
  friendlyShopDescription: 'wigamau''s tradehouse is positively packed with people,
    but just over the crowd you see a very excited trademin hopping about and waving
    at you.


    once you push your way through the crowd, he exclaims "it''s you!!!!!!
    i wasn''t expecting to make a sale today, but now you''re here!!! sweet!!!!!"


    now
    that he mentions it, despite the massive crowd, all the shelves are still fully
    stocked.'
